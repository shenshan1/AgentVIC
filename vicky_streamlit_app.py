- **Hiss Exercise:** Inhale deeply for 4 seconds, exhale with a long steady “ssss” sound. Repeat 5 times.

Try 5 minutes of focused breathing before singing.

- **5-Tone Scale:** Sing Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So (C-D-E-F-G), then back down. Use a piano app or tuner to match.  
- **Pitch Matching:** Play a single note (e.g. C4) and hold it. Check against a piano or digital tuner.

Daily repetition improves pitch control.

- **Volume Swells:** Sustain a note and gradually increase/decrease volume without cracking.

- **Breath Tap-outs:** Sing “ha ha ha” on one breath to build diaphragm coordination.

These will build vocal agility and balance.

- **Semi-Tone Steps:** Go up a half step each time you repeat a short phrase.  
- **Yawning Warmup:** Do light yawns while humming to gently open your throat.

Stretch slowly. Never push too hard past your comfortable range.
